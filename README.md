## Who am I

After a one-year internship, I look for opportunities as a web developer be it front, back or fullstack.

I worked at Medhop on testing Orgo, Vincent Mireau's Operating Room management software for hospitals.

I impulsed the automation of E2E tests based on Cypress and for now I try my best to move the app from PHP generated pages to a full Vue web app. 

OpenClassrooms was my school, giving me projects, assessments and weekly support from Yann-Erwann Le Calvez, my tutor. You'll find most on my Github repos. Each is simple and oriented toward learning some key aspects of Web developement. My last one was a Node/Express based API for a  web app. The next will be a complete web app for chat !

Moreover, I'm soon to be father of two and like hiking and boxing. If you like it too, why not get in touch and go boxing or hiking ? I'd be gladly surprised !

## What can I do for you

Anything involving web developement !

Not that I know so much but I feel able to learn anything I need to resolve complex tasks.

UI/UX may not be my favourite, but I'm opened to Front end application developpement as well as DevOps and Back end as long as it require more logical thinking than creative design.
